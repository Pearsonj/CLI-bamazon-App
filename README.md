# bamazon application

Welcome to my mock amazon CLI app. Bamazon! (Original I know). This CLI app simulates a customer purchasing items from a web site and then updating the MySQL Database that our products are stored in. 

So first we run the app with node:</br>

Then We Are Shown All Our Products:</br>

After That We Are Prompted To Enter The ID Of The Item We Want To Purchase:</br>
